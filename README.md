The project involved a vast dataset with over 1.8 million records.

# Solution Highlights
1. Finance View: Drill down into Profit & Loss, Net Sales trends, and identify top products and customers by various metrics.
2. Sales View: Analyze Customer and Product performance metrics like Net Sales, Gross Margin %, and unit economics (COGS, deductions).
3. Marketing View: Gain a comprehensive overview of Product, Market, Regional, and Customer performance, including GM%, NP%, and unit economics with detailed COGS and expenses.
4. Supply Chain View: Measure Forecast Accuracy, Net Error, and Absolute Error, and track accuracy and error trends for supply chain optimization.
5. Executive View: A real-time executive dashboard to monitor performance by division, customers, products, and channels.

# Steps Followed
1. Project planning and scoping:The Project Planning and Scoping phase ensured that the Power BI dashboard for AtliQ Hardwares was delivered within scope, on time, and with the right set of features to meet 
   business needs. By defining clear objectives, understanding stakeholder requirements, and setting boundaries, the project was structured to deliver meaningful insights across multiple business 
   functions,enabling data-driven decisions.This involved
    - Defining Project Objectives and Goals:
         - Improve the efficiency of reporting and reduce the time spent on manual data manipulation.
         - Deliver a user-friendly dashboard that integrates various data sources (sales, inventory, finance, etc.) for a holistic view of the business.
           
    - Stakeholder Identification and Involvement:Scoping the project also means identifying all key stakeholders (e.g., department heads, end users, decision-makers) who will be involved in the project or who 
                                                 will benefit from it. Stakeholders may include people from Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Supply Chain teams in the case of your Power BI dashboard project.
      
                                                 The steps involved are:
                                                          - Clarify stakeholder expectations: Understanding what each stakeholder group needs from the dashboard, which features and KPIs are most important to them.
                                                          - Regular communication and feedback: Plan for ongoing discussions and feedback loops to ensure the project is aligned with user needs throughout the 
                                                            development process.
      
    - Scope Definition:The scope of the project is defined by clearly outlining the specific deliverables, features, and functionality of the project. This includes deciding what will be included—and, just as 
                       importantly, what will not be included—in the final deliverable.
      
    - Estimating Time,Resources and Budget:A detailed project timeline should be created, with clearly defined milestones and deadlines. This includes estimating the time and resources required for each stage of 
                                           the project.
      
    - Risk Identification and Mitigation:Risk planning involves identifying potential challenges or risks that could hinder project progress.For each risk, mitigation strategies should be outlined.
  
    - Deliverables and Mitigation:The final deliverables should be clearly defined in the planning stage.These include:
                                    - A fully functional Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights across key departments.
                                    - User guides or training materials to help stakeholders navigate and utilize the dashboard.
                                    - Documentation for future updates or maintenance.

    - Communication Plan:
        - A solid communication plan is necessary to keep all team members and stakeholders updated. This includes:
          
                -  Regular progress updates: Schedule recurring meetings to discuss the project’s progress, address any challenges, and align with stakeholders on evolving requirements.
                -  Documentation of key decisions: Document any significant changes, feedback, or decisions made throughout the project.
